Get me IP address of particular domain (guvi.in) - nslookup command

How do I find my CPU/memory usage of my server? - free/ top command

Test the connectivity between 2 nodes? - ping command to check connectivity

I have deployed an application in guvi.com:9000, and logs shows my app is running, but Iâ€™m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not ?
     telnet command can be used to check but it is old and not secure. I tried with nmap to check the port. Not sure about lsof and netstat - explanation required.

added screenshots in separate folder
